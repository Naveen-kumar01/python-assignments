What is the concept of delegation?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - Delegation is an object oriented technique. let x be an object you want to change the function of just one of its\n      methods. You can create a new class that provides a new definition of the method you are interested in changing \n      and delegates all other methods to the corresponding method of x."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q3. What is the concept of composition?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - Composition is a concept that describe a, 'has a' relationship. It enables creating complex types by combining objects of \n      other types. This means that a class Composite can contain an object of another class Component. This relationship \n      means that a Composite has a Component.\n      In this concept, we will describe a class that references to one or more objects of other classes as an Instance \n      variable. Here, by using the class name or by creating the object we can access the members of one class inside \n      another class."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q4. What are bound methodsÂ and how do we use them?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - In the bound methods, the instance obj is passed by itself as the first argument to the function called and hence the \n      first parameter of the function will be used to reach all the variables/functions of the object.\n      All the new version of the python which are 3.0 and above have methods that are by default bound methods."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q5. What is the purpose of pseudoprivate attributes?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - The purpose of using pseudoprivate attributes is to avoid introducing new method names that might accidentally hide \n      definitions and also to reduce the chance of internal methods being replaced by names defined lower in the tree.\n      In Python, all instance attributes wind up in the single instance object at the bottom of the class tree. The value \n      of the self variable is modified by the last method it was called by."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.13","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
