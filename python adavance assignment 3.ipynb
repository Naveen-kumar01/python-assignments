{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - An abstract superclass is also known as abstract base class. In an abstract class contains at least one abstract,\n      method or more. An abstract method is the method which does not contain any implementation. But these abstract methods\n      must be implemented in the subclass/child class.\n      All the abstract methods must be implemented in the child class,failing to do so will raise TypeError."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q2. What happens when a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - The Top-level statements contain variables,constants,functions and class description.The class can be private by using\n      the private keyword. Private definitions are only visible in the module that defines them. Definitions that are not\n      private are public. The top-level may also include statements. As an exception, a function named Main is always \n      private even if the definition is not prefixed with private.There is also a chance of getter and setter functions,\n      Object identity and state."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q3. Why does a class need to manually call a superclass's __init__ method?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - The main aim of __init__ method is to initialise the variables of the class, hence the manual call for parent class \n      init meyhod will help you to get access of the varibles and funvtions that are present in the base class otherwise \n      you will not be able to access any variable of base class in the inherited class.So if you don't call base class init,\n      none of that code would be executed and you would end up with base class that has no variables."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q4. How can you augment, instead of completely replacing, an inherited method?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - A subclass can either completely override the implementation for an inherited method or the subclass can enhance the\n      method by adding functionality to it. Replacing a Superclass's Method Implementation. Sometimes, a subclass will want\n      to replace entirely its superclass's implementation of a method. Indeed, many superclasses provide an empty method\n      implementation with the expectation that most, if not all, subclasses will completely replace the superclass's\n      implementation of the method."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q5. How is the local scope of a class different from that of a function?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - Declaring a variable in a class: \n      functions can access basically a public variable - this is like a static variable and can be called \n      using the class name.These variables are available to all functions, any functions can use it.\n\n      Declaring a variable inside a function inside a class,only that function can access it - if the variable is declared             without self then it is accessible within that function only.However if it is declared using self like self, then it is         accessible via any object but not via the class name."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.13","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
