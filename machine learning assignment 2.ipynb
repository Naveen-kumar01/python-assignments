{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q1. What is the concept of human learning? Please give two examples."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - The humans learn by visualising, audio analysing, reading and writing. The human start learning from birth, when they are       small they try to learn through visualising things, and when they grow they try to understand and increase there knowledge       by reading ,writing and analysing things."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q2. What different forms of human learning are there? Are there any machine learning equivalents?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - Supervised learning is similar to concept learning, where a person is required to classify new objects into existing             categories, by matching the features of the new objects to examples in the categories.\n      Reinforcement learning is inspired by the reward system of operant conditioning, just like in the maze, they can go             anywhere but they try and choose the right path by committing mistake."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q3. What is machine learning, and how does it work? What are the key responsibilities of machine learning?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - The machine learning is a part of the AI. The machine learning focuses on learning the relationship that is established         between the features and the target variable. There are various kind of machine learning algorithms that help us to study       and identify these relationship. There is supervised, unsupervised and semisupervised learning."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q4. Define the terms penalty and reward in the context of reinforcement learning."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - The term penality is used for every wrong decision and term reward is used for every correct decision."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q5. Explain the term 'learning as a search'?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - machine learning is challenging because the designing of a perfect learning system for a given problem in intractable.           There is no best training data or best algorithm for your problem, only the best that you can discover."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q6. What are the various goals of machine learning? What is the relationship between these and human learning?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - The main aim of machine learning is to analyse the data and study the patternthat is followd by the data in order to come       up with a model which can predict accuratly the data in new instances.\n      Supervised learning is similar to concept learning, where a person is required to classify new objects into existing             categories, by matching the features of the new objects to examples in the categories."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q7. Illustrate the various elements of machine learning using a real-life illustration."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - The elements that are present in ML are representation which is equivalent to visualisation, optimisation which is               equivalent to error finding, evaluation which involes hypothesis testing . "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q8. Provide an example of the abstraction method."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - The abstraction method is the function which does not include any body and it must be implemeted in the inherited class         otherwise it throws exception error. the class that contain such method is called abstract class."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q9. What is the concept of generalization? What function does it play in the machine learning process?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - The term generalisation is used for the model we are using for prediction if the model is not overfited and underfitted  it will give good test set accuracy, then we conclude that our model is generalising well on the test set."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q10. What is classification, exactly? What are the main distinctions between classification and regression?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - The classification problem are mainly used for predicting a discrete class label. Regression is the task of predicting a         continuous quantity."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q11. What is regression, and how does it work? Give an example of a real-world problem that was solved using regression."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - The regression is method used for predicting the interval/ratio data, like the price of the house or predicting the             temperature. These kind of problem are solved using regression. We try to analyse the relationship between various feature       and how they affect the target feature. The linear regression is on example of regression algorithms. The linear                 regression work on the residual error in the data.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q12. Describe the clustering mechanism in detail."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - The clustering is used to classify the data into various gropus/category that show similar behaviour to each other. It forms various clusters for different kind of groups, it uses the euclidean distance to calculate the distance between to points. This is what is called clustering. There are various algorithm of clustering like k means, dbscan, heirarchical clustering."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q13. Make brief observations on two of the following topics:\n\ni. Machine learning algorithms are used\nii. Studying under supervision\niii. Studying without supervision\niv. Reinforcement learning is a form of learning based on positive reinforcement."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans - \n     (i)The machine learning focuses on learning the relationship that is established between the features and the target               variable. There are various kind of machine learning algorithms that help us to study and identify these relationship.\n     (ii)The supervision is similar to supervised learning, which uses the target variable and the features to establish the              relationship between them and then generate prediction on the test data.
